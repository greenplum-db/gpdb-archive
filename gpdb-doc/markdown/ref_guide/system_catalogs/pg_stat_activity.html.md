# pg_stat_activity 

The view `pg_stat_activity` shows one row per server process with details about the associated user session and query. The columns that report data on the current query are available unless the parameter `stats_command_string` has been turned off. Furthermore, these columns are only visible if the user examining the view is a superuser or the same as the user owning the process being reported on.

The maximum length of the query text string stored in the column `query` can be controlled with the server configuration parameter `track_activity_query_size`.

|`xact_start`|timestamptz| |Transaction start time|
|`query_start`|timestamptz| |Time query began execution|
|`state_change`|timestampz| |Time when the `state` was last changed|
|`wait_event_type`|text| |Type of event for which the backend is waiting|
