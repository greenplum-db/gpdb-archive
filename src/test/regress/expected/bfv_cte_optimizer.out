-- The following tests ensures queries involving CTE don't hang in ORCA or fall back.
-- Query hang is caused by a mismatch between the number of CTE producers and
-- consumers. Either there are more producers than consumers, or more consumers than
-- producers, the unconsumed producers or the starved consumers would cause the query
-- to hang. Query fall back, on the other hand, is due to a missing plan that satisfies
-- all the required plan properties. The issues stated above are fixed by sending
-- appropriate distribution requests based on how data is distributed to begin with,
-- to ensure the number of CTE producers and consumers match. For each of the tests,
-- we use explain to verify the plan and the actual query to verify the query doesn't
-- hang.
-- This test involves a tainted-replicated CTE and two consumer 
-- To ensure there's no duplicate hazard, the cost model chooses a plan that gathers
-- the CTE onto the coordinator. Both the producer and the consumer executes on the
-- coordiator. There's 1 producer matching 1 consumer.
