-- Test: SELECT or other read-only operations which set hint bits on pages,
-- and in turn generate Full Page Images (FPI) WAL records should be throttled.

-- synchronous replication, it should not block the CHECKPOINT process, and if
-- the mirror is taken down, synchronous replication should be turned off and
-- the backend should stop waiting for synchronous replication and proceed.

-- Setup:
-- 1. Set wait_for_replication_threshold to 1kB for quicker test
-- 2. create two tables (one small and one large)
-- 3. set gp_disable_tuple_hints=off so buffer will be immediately marked dirty on hint bit change
