-- Scenario to test, CHECKPOINT getting distributed transaction
-- information between COMMIT processing time window
-- `XLogInsert(RM_XACT_ID, XLOG_XACT_DISTRIBUTED_COMMIT)` and
-- insertedDistributedCommitted(). `delayChkpt` protects this
-- case. There used to bug in placement of getDtxCheckPointInfo() in
-- checkpoint code causing, transaction to be committed on coordinator
-- and aborted on segments. Test case is meant to validate
-- getDtxCheckPointInfo() gets called after
-- GetVirtualXIDsDelayingChkpt().
--
-- Test controls the progress of COMMIT executed in session 1 and of
-- CHECKPOINT executed in the checkpointer process, with high-level
-- flow:
--
-- 1. session 1: COMMIT is blocked at start_insertedDistributedCommitted
-- 2. checkpointer: Start a CHECKPOINT and wait to reach before_wait_VirtualXIDsDelayingChkpt
-- 3. session 1: COMMIT is resumed
-- 4. checkpointer: CHECKPOINT is resumed and executes to keep_log_seg to finally introduce panic and perform crash recovery
--
-- Bug existed when getDtxCheckPointInfo() was invoked before
-- GetVirtualXIDsDelayingChkpt(), getDtxCheckPointInfo() will not
-- contain the distributed transaction in session1 whose state is
-- DTX_STATE_INSERTED_COMMITTED.  Therefore, after crash recovery, the
-- 2PC transaction that has been committed on coordinator will be
-- considered as orphaned prepared transaction hence is aborted at
-- segments. As a result the SELECT executed by session3 used to fail
-- because the twopcbug table only existed on the coordinator.
